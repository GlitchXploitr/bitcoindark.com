        <p>In 1993 a group of activists published <a
        href="http://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html" target="_blank">A
        Cypherpunk’s manifesto</a>, a document that explored the fundamental
        importance of privacy for an open society in the electronic age and the
        necessity of cryptography to protect it. The power of the internet, smartphones
        and social networking have brought about the reality of mass communication, and
        with it, the ability to gather information about others on an unprecedented
        scale. </p>
        <blockquote class="serif text-center nomargin">
            <em>
              ‘Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn’t
              want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn’t want
              anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the
              world... Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say
              something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it.’

    <h2>Privacy and financial freedom</h2>
    <hr class="primary center">
</div>
<div class="col-lg-6">
    <p>
      Today, over two decades later, the
      encryption technologies advocated by the Cypherpunks have developed – and so
      have the threats that catalysed their movement. We have learned how the
      concentration of surveillance technologies in the hands of undemocratic and
      unaccountable groups has led to injustices that remained hidden from public
      view for years. We see the erosion of civil liberties and the assumption of
      guilt inherent in mass surveillance.
      We have also seen how the
      concentration of financial power has led to the exploitation of our economic
      system by the already wealthy, with little recourse for ordinary citizens.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-6">
    <p>
      We witnessed the Global Financial Crisis, brought about by the irresponsible
      stewardship of our money by the financial elite, but paid for by ordinary
      taxpayers. We follow the news of political interests preventing meaningful
      reform, of market crashes brought about by economic incompetence, and the
      threat of confiscations to pay for the excesses and moral hazards that are
      endemic to the present system. We recognise the injustice of the unilateral
      seizure of wealth that is inflation, and the absurdity of claiming that this
      is beneficial to those against whom it is perpetrated.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
    <h2>The democratisation of information</h2>
    <hr class="primary center">
</div>
<div class="col-lg-6">
    <p>
      Information is and will always be power. When information is made freely
      available and distributed among the greatest number of people, the power of
      the financial, political and technological elites to whom it was previously
      confined is inevitably threatened. They will not voluntarily permit this.
      Therefore, in the <a href="http://www.toad.com/gnu/cfp.talk.txt"
      target="_blank">words of John Gilmore</a>, the guarantees of the freedoms we
      consider so foundational to an open society must be made by the laws of
      physics and mathematics, not bestowed as a temporary privilege by the
      authority of a state.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-6">
   <p>
     Cryptographic protocols and currencies provide, for the first time in the
     electronic age, the ability to communicate and transact freely and anonymously,
     making known only what we wish to make known to others. They enable trade and
     commerce that are not conducted under terms dictated by a third party, that are
     not subject to their arbitrary intervention, and that are not subject to abuses
     that range from mandatory fees through to collusion and outright market
     manipulation.
   </p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
    <h2>BitcoinDark: free and private investment</h2>
    <hr class="primary center">
</div>

<div class="col-lg-6">
  <p>
    The BitcoinDark (BTCD) platform includes four features and ideals we believe
    are critical to the healthy functioning and growth of the crypto economy that
    we hope will become a parallel and alternative to the traditional fiat
    economy, encapsulated by the D.a.r.k acronym:
  </p>
  <h3>Decentralisation.</h3>
  <p>
    Only a truly decentralised system can
    be owned by its users, free from interference from vested interests and
    hostile authorities. Although bitcoin paved the way for all cryptocurrencies,
    many of these – including bitcoin itself – have become dangerously
    centralised through corporate interests and reliance on infrastructure-heavy
    proof-of-work mining. BitcoinDark is built on a proof-of-stake system that is
    both secure and resistant to attack from centralisation.
  </p>
  <h3>Anonymity.</h3>
  <p>
    The freedom of speech and privacy – financial or otherwise – that are key to an
    open society require anonymous communication as standard. Privacy is built into
    the BitcoinDark platform from the ground up. We recognise that some people may
    choose to abuse this anonymity, just as they have chosen to abuse the anonymity
    of physical cash or the potential complexity of electronic transfers. We
    consider this a lesser evil than the injustices described above and a price that
    must be paid to maintain freedom.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-6">

  <h3>Realtime exchange.</h3>
  <p>
    The blockchain technology on which cryptocurrencies are built enables an
    immutable record of transactions, but this comes at the cost of speed.
    BitcoinDark has integrated the decentralised InstantDEX exchange to enable
    near-realtime trading of currencies, commodities and assets.
  </p>
  <h3>Key currencies.</h3>
  <p>
    Volatility has characterised most
    cryptocurrencies to date, compromising what would otherwise be a desperately
    needed store of value. BitcoinDark will enable users to ‘lock’ funds against
    real-world currencies, commodities and stock indices, redeeming them for their
    value in BTCD at a later time. Together with its realtime exchange, this will
    enable users to trade effectively and manage their own accounts and portfolios
    of investments, entirely outside of the existing financial system.
  </p>
  <hr class="primary">
  <p>
    We are not messianic about the potential of this technology or naïve
    about its limitations, knowing that it will always be human nature to
    exploit the vulnerabilities of any financial system. All we demand is a
    level playing field. Since this has never before been available to us, we
    have built the tools to access it ourselves. We understand that this may be
    unpalatable to some people. For the rest, the BitcoinDark platform is and
    will always be free for anyone to use, modify and improve.
